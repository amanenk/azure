# Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all privileged users (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Enable multi-factor authentication for all user credentials who have write access to Azure resources. These include roles like
 - Service Co-Administrators
 - Subscription Owners
 - Contributors

## Rationale:

Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.
