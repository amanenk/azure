# Ensure that 'Automatic provisioning of monitoring agent' is set to 'On' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Enable automatic provisioning of the monitoring agent to collect security data.

## Rationale:

When `Automatic provisioning of monitoring agent` is turned on, Azure Security Center provisions the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on all existing supported Azure virtual machines and any new ones that are created. The Microsoft Monitoring Agent scans for various security-related configurations and events such as system updates, OS vulnerabilities, endpoint protection, and provides alerts.
