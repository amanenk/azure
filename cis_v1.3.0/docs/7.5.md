# Ensure that the latest OS Patches for all Virtual Machines are applied (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Ensure that the latest OS patches for all virtual machines are applied.

## Rationale:

Windows and Linux virtual machines should be kept updated to:
 - Address a specific bug or flaw
 - Improve an OS or applicationâ€™s general stability
 - Fix a security vulnerability

The Azure Security Center retrieves a list of available security and critical updates from Windows Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), depending on which service is configured on a Windows VM. The security center also checks for the latest updates in Linux systems. If a VM is missing a system update, the security center will recommend system updates be applied.
