# Ensure that storage account access keys are periodically regenerated (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Regenerate storage account access keys periodically.

## Rationale:

When a storage account is created, Azure generates two 512-bit storage access keys, which are used for authentication when the storage account is accessed. Rotating these keys periodically ensures that any inadvertent access or exposure does not result in these keys being compromised.
