# Ensure the web app has 'Client Certificates (Incoming client certificates)' set to 'On' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2 

## Description:

Client certificates allow for the app to request a certificate for incoming requests. Only clients that have a valid certificate will be able to reach the app.

## Rationale:

The TLS mutual authentication technique in enterprise environments ensures the authenticity of clients to the server. If incoming client certificates are enabled, then only an authenticated client who has valid certificates can access the app.
