# Ensure that VHD's are encrypted (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description:

VHD (Virtual Hard Disks) are stored in BLOB storage and are the old style disks that were attached to Virtual Machines, and the BLOB VHD was then leased to the VM. By Default storage accounts are not encrypted, and Azure Defender(Security Centre) would then recommend that the OS disks should be encrypted. Storage accounts can be encrypted as a whole using PMK or CMK and this should be turned on for storage accounts containing VHD's.

## Rationale:

With the changes that have been made that recommend using managed disks that are encrypted by default, we need to also have a recommendation that "legacy" disk that may for a number of reasons need to be left as VHD's should also be encrypted to protect the data content.
