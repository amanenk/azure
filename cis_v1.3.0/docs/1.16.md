# Ensure that 'Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Pane' is set to 'No' (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description:

Restrict group creation to administrators only.

## Rationale:

Self-service group management enables users to create and manage security groups or Office 365 groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Unless a business requires this day-to-day delegation for some users, self-service group management should be disabled.
