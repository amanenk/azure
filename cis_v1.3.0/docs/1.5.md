# Ensure that 'Number of methods required to reset' is set to '2' (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Ensure that two alternate forms of identification are provided before allowing a password reset.

## Rationale:

Like multi-factor authentication, setting up dual identification before allowing a password reset ensures that the user identity is confirmed via two separate forms of identification. With dual identification set, an attacker would require compromising both the identity forms before he/she could maliciously reset a user's password.
