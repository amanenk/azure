# Ensure that 'Public access level' is set to Private for blob containers (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Disable anonymous access to blob containers and disallow blob public access on storage account.

## Rationale:

Anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs can be enabled in Azure Blob storage. It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a shared access signature. It is recommended not to provide anonymous access to blob containers until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature token should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers. If no anonymous access is needed on the storage account, itâ€™s recommended to set allowBlobPublicAccess false.
