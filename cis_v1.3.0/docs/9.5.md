# Ensure that Register with Azure Active Directory is enabled on App Service (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Managed service identity in App Service makes the app more secure by eliminating secrets from the app, such as credentials in the connection strings. When registering with Azure Active Directory in the app service, the app will connect to other Azure services securely without the need of username and passwords.

## Rationale:

App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service in Azure. It also provides a managed identity for apps, which is a turn-key solution for securing access to Azure SQL Database and other Azure services.
