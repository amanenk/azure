# Ensure 'Allow access to Azure services' for PostgreSQL Database Server is disabled (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Disable access from Azure services to PostgreSQL Database Server

## Rationale:

If access from Azure services is enabled, the server's firewall will accept connections from all Azure resources, including resources not in your subscription. This is usually not a desired configuration. Instead, setup firewall rules to allow access from specific network ranges or VNET rules to allow access from specific virtual networks.
