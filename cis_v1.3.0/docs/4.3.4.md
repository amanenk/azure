# Ensure server parameter 'log_connections' is set to 'ON' for PostgreSQL Database Server (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Enable `log_connections` on `PostgreSQL` Servers.

## Rationale:

Enabling `log_connections` helps PostgreSQL Database to log attempted connection to the server, as well as successful completion of client authentication. Log data can be used to identify, troubleshoot, and repair configuration errors and suboptimal performance.
