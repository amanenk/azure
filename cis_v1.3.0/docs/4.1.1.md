# Ensure that 'Auditing' is set to 'On' (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Enable auditing on SQL Servers.

## Rationale:

The Azure platform allows a SQL server to be created as a service. Enabling auditing at the server level ensures that all existing and newly created databases on the SQL server instance are audited. Auditing policy applied on the SQL database does not override auditing policy and settings applied on the particular SQL server where the database is hosted.
