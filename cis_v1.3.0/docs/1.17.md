# Ensure that 'Users can create security groups in Azure Portals' is set to 'No' (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description:

Restrict security group creation to administrators only.

## Rationale:

When creating security groups is enabled, all users in the directory are allowed to create new security groups and add members to those groups. Unless a business requires this day-to-day delegation, security group creation should be restricted to administrators only.
