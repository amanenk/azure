# Ensure that 'Unattached disks' are encrypted with CMK (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 2

## Description:

Ensure that unattached disks in a subscription are encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK).

## Rationale:

Managed disks are encrypted by default with Platform-managed keys. Using Customer-managed keys may provide an additional level of security or meet an organization's regulatory requirements. Encrypting managed disks ensures that its entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key and thus protects the volume from unwarranted reads. Even if the disk is not attached to any of the VMs, there is always a risk where a compromised user account with administrative access to VM service can mount/attach these data disks which may lead to sensitive information disclosure and tampering.
