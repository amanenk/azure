# Ensure server parameter 'connection_throttling' is set to 'ON' for PostgreSQL Database Server (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Enable `connection_throttling` on `PostgreSQL` Servers.

## Rationale:

Enabling `connection_throttling` helps the PostgreSQL Database to `Set the verbosity of logged messages` which in turn generates query and error logs with respect to concurrent connections, that could lead to a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources. A system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Query and error logs can be used to identify, troubleshoot, and repair configuration errors and sub-optimal performance.
