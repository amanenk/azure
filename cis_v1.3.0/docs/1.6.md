# Ensure that 'Number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information' is not set to "0" (Manual)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Ensure that the number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information is not set to 0.

## Rationale:

If authentication re-confirmation is disabled, registered users will never be prompted to re-confirm their existing authentication information. If the authentication information for a user, such as a phone number or email changes, then the password reset information for that user reverts to the previously registered authentication information.
